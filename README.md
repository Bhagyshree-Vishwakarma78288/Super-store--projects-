# Super-store--projects-
I developed a Super Store management system using Python to handle inventory, sales, and customer data. The purpose was to streamline store operations and enhance decision-making. Tools included Python for scripting and data management, with libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.
